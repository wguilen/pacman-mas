# pacman-mas
Pacman's implementation as a Multiagent System using [JADE Framework](http://jade.tilab.com/).


### The Game

- Ghosts tries to coordinate for killing Pacman;
- Pacman tries to avoid being killed;
- If Pacman collects a powerup item, ghosts tries to run away from it;
- If Pacman collects every collectible item on the board, it wins.


### Version
Only an alpha version is currently developed. There are no plans on continuing this project as it was used just for validating my knowledges on multiagent systems using [JADE Framework](http://jade.tilab.com/).
